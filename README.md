# Speech Processing Ontology

A comprehensive and pioneering computational ontology that formally structures the domain of speech processing tasks. Developed from scratch using Bermejo's methodology (2007), this ontology encapsulates 79 core concepts to serve as a foundational framework for researchers and practitioners in speech science.

> **Abstract:** This project introduces a structured framework to categorize and relate the diverse tasks in speech science. Informing by seminal literature and cutting-edge research, it offers a robust hierarchy, defined relationships, and properties to enhance knowledge exchange and collaborative research.

## Project Overview

This ontology provides a centralized, structured repository for the entire spectrum of speech processing, covering areas such as:
- **Speech Recognition & Synthesis**
- **Speaker Verification & Identification**
- **Speech Coding & Transmission**
- **Voice Discrimination & Perception**
- **Acoustic Feature Analysis**

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Coverage:** 79 meticulously selected main concepts representing core speech processing tasks.
- **Formal Structure:** Built in OWL using Protégé, with optimized class hierarchy and defined object/data properties.
- **Dynamic & Adaptable:** Designed to evolve with the field, accommodating emerging technologies and research.
- **Research-Ready:** Serves as a foundational tool for semantic analysis, reasoning, and systematic literature reviews.

## Methodology

Developed following Bermejo's structured approach:
1.  **Domain Scoping:** Encompassing all speech processing tasks.
2.  **Resource Analysis:** Identified a gap in existing resources, necessitating original creation.
3.  **Terminology Extraction:** Drawing from foundational texts and emerging research.
4.  **Class Creation & Hierarchy Design:** 79 main concepts with carefully resolved terminological overlaps (e.g., Speaker Verification vs. Voice Discrimination).
5.  **Relationship Definition:** Properties like 'precedes' and 'followed by' create a dynamic knowledge network.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Protégé** ontology editor ([Download here](https://protege.stanford.edu/)) to view, explore, and edit the ontology.

### Installation & Exploration
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RaziehZare/Speech-Processing-Ontology.git

2. Open the Speech_Processing_Ontology.owl file in Protégé.
3. Explore the class hierarchy, object properties, and data properties through the Protégé interface.
